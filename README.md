# Airline & Aircraft DBMS Term Project

## Description
Completed on 05/02/2024

This repository holds my Database project created during the spring semester of 2024. It utilizes MySQL and the Java Database Connector (JDBC) to funciton. 

The project contains a total of 10 queries that simulate different requests from the user using a standalone CLI. 

This is one of my favorite projects with because of how I find databasing interesting and the potential projects I can do with this! In future plans, I want to make a little UI graphic seeing live time flights coming in and out using this database and several APIs.
Hopefully to start on that soon once im done with my Senior Design Project!
